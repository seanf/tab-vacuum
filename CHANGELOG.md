# Changelog

All notable changes to Tab Vacuum will be documented here. Format roughly follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) with [SemVer](https://semver.org/) versioning.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Pinned tabs could be closed as duplicates when an unpinned copy of the same URL was in an earlier window (#2). Pinned tabs are now always kept, claim their URL before deduping, and are left in their own window (moving one to the end of another window unpinned it) and out of grouping.

### Changed
- Tabs in non-normal windows (PWAs running in their own window, popups, devtools) are no longer closed, moved or grouped (#1). Unpinned duplicates of their pages in normal windows are still removed.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-19

### Added
- **"Current window only" toggle** in a new options page (right-click the toolbar icon → Options). When enabled, Tab Vacuum dedupes and groups only within the window you click in, leaving other windows untouched.
- `chrome.storage.local`-backed preference persistence (single boolean, never transmitted, never synced).
- New manifest permission: `storage` — used solely for the preference above.

### Changed
- Default behavior is **unchanged** — Tab Vacuum still acts on every open Chrome window unless you explicitly turn the new toggle on. Existing users see no difference.
- `manifest.json` `name` field corrected from "Clean Tabs" (a leftover from the prototype) to "Tab Vacuum" — matches the Chrome Web Store listing and the toolbar tooltip you actually see post-install.
- `default_title` updated to "Tab Vacuum — clean duplicate tabs" for consistency.

### Files added
- `options.html` (~60 lines, dark theme matching brand)
- `options.js` (9 lines)

### Notes
- The "no settings" claim in earlier marketing has been softened to "one optional toggle" — that's now the literal truth.
- All preferences stay on your device. Nothing syncs to a Google account or any server. The privacy story is intact.

## [1.0] — 2026-06-07

### Initial release
- ~50 lines of vanilla JavaScript, MIT licensed
- Click toolbar icon → removes every duplicate tab across all open Chrome windows (matched by URL)
- Surviving tabs merge into the window where you clicked
- Remaining tabs auto-grouped by hostname, collapsed by default
- Two permissions: `tabs`, `tabGroups`
- No background activity, no network calls, no analytics, no accounts
